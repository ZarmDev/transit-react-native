# TransitApp
A transit app for NYC.

It was built for Cider and also to learn React Native.

# What it uses
- The transitHelper library (https://github.com/ZarmDev/transitHelper).
- Openstreetmap data
- Leaflet.js
- It uses React WebView to render the map

# Thanks
All the unzip code is thanks to this github repo: (I couldn't figure it out for days because of the errors, so I love this repo)

A lot of AI was used to debug and to create functions like DraggableContainer.

Originally, I was trying to use the react-native-maps library but I really didn't want to pay Google Maps so
thanks OpenStreetMaps!
